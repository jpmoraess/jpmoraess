### Hello, I'm João Pedro ✌

I’m an experienced backend developer, passionate about solving complex problems with clean and efficient code. Java and Spring Framework are my go-to tools, but recently, I’ve been diving into Kotlin and even exploring Golang to keep my skills sharp and up-to-date.

I’m always focused on building reliable, scalable systems and designing APIs that truly make life easier for both developers and users. Whether I’m optimizing systems, solving tricky problems, or exploring new technologies, I’m always ready for the next challenge.
